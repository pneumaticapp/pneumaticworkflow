# Pneumatic: All Workflows all the Time



**Pneumatic** is an open-source SaaS workflow management system designed to streamline and organize workflows in businesses of any size. Originally developed as a cloud-based platform, Pneumatic empowers teams by enabling them to set up, run, and optimize workflows collaboratively, tracking each stage as tasks move from team to team.

## Key Features

**Workflow Templates:** Create custom workflow templates and reuse them for repetitive processes. Templates define a series of steps that can be used across multiple workflows.

**Multi-Workflow Management:** Once templates are set, create multiple workflows from each template and run them in parallel, adapting them as needed.

**Task Buckets for Staff:** Pneumatic focuses on individual task management, giving each staff member their own bucket of tasks. Staffers can complete tasks efficiently by emptying their buckets one by one.

**Automated Workflow Tracking:** With automated tracking, Pneumatic provides real-time insight into each workflowâ€™s stage and automates handoffs between teams as tasks progress from step to step.

## Getting Started

You can grab your own copy of Pneumatic by cloning this repository and self-hosting it on your machine/instance. Here's a quick start guide:


### Prerequisites
* Operating System: Linux(Ubuntu/Debian), macOS or Windows(install and run at your own risk)
* Docker version 2.27 or above
* Docker compose version 27.0 or above
* At least 8GB of RAM
* At least 50GB of diskspace
* Ports 80, 443, and 8001 must be open and not in use by any other process(like apache or nginx)


### Get the files

You can either clone the repository using git like so

```
git clone https://github.com/pneumaticapp/pneumaticworkflow.git
```
or, you can simply download the [project's master folder](https://github.com/pneumaticapp/pneumaticworkflow/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and unzip it

### Edit the configuration files if necessary

If you want to be accessing Pneumatic over the Internet and the machine you plan to be running it on has an external IP address/domain name, you need to replace all references to localhost in config/project.env and config/frontend.env with your machine's IP address/domain name.

project.env and frontend.env are to be found in the config directory within the Pneumatic project directory.
Open them with an editor of your choice and find-and-replace all references to localhost with your machine's IP address/domain name.

### Run Pneumatic

To run Pneumatic cd into the project's directory and run the command

```
docker compose up -d
```
This will run it in detached mode, if you want to see what's happening omit the -d flag.

Alternatively, you can run the Pneumatic containers from Docker Desktop.

### Open Pneumatic and register a free account

Once the containers are up and running go to http://your-server-address (http://localhost if you're connecting from the same machine) in your browser, register a free account and you're good to go.
